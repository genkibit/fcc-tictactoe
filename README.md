Synopsis
---
This is one of a series of projects for the front-end program of **[freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)**. The goal is to make the game tic-tac-toe. This version is based on the one that appears in the movie War Games.

The project rubric is as follows:

+ Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: ()[https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/].
+ Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
+ Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
+ User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
+ User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
+ User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
